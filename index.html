                          <p class="u-text u-text-3"> In June of 1933, a government sponsored corporation was created as a part of the New Deal named the Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC). The goal of this corporation was to carry out the provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act, that aimed to provide relief to homeowners unable to finance their mortgages. Redlining is the method this organization employed to determine neighborhoods across US cities which were deemed safe or hazardous for investment, using grades 'A' through 'D'.<br>The unfortunate reality of this process is that in practically all cases, neighborhoods receiving the lowest grade of 'D', and subsequently outlined and shaded in red on the map, were largely populated with racial and ethnic minorities. This systemic disinvestment in these neighborhoods furthered existing problems, notably racially segregating cities even more, and making it much more difficult or expensive for minorities to secure a loan and buy a home.

The purpose of the law was to “provide emergency relief with respect to home mortgage indebtedness, to refinance home mortgages, to extend relief to the owners occupied by them and who are unable to amortize their debt elsewhere…” The law also ordered the creation of a Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) to carry out the provisions of the act.

When compared to the 1937 redlining map, the lasting impacts of redlining are clear. While the South Baltimore/Inner Harbor area has been developed extensively and thus shows higher average income levels now, such investment into development has not been seen across the board. Instead, we see households in areas that were redlined like Jonestown and Oldtown continuing to have an average income of nearly 4 times less than those in areas with class A or “first grade” designations like Guilford and Homeland.<br>
                  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This difference is perhaps even more apparent in the case of the Middle East neighborhood. This neighborhood was redlined (along with adjacent neighborhoods) with a class D designation, while the Johns Hopkins Hospital in the area was exempted from such a designation. While the hospital has continued to develop and improve, average incomes in this neighborhood remain at less than half the overall Baltimore City average, and a jarring 5 times less than the Greater Roland Park neighborhood, an area containing only class A and B designated districts. This clearly highlights the impact of redlining: communities with potential continuing to be held back from developing as a result of outdated restrictions and labels.

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">With the original design of the HOLC for relieving issues for mortgage payers, it is natural that inequality as related to housing is still seen today. When neighborhoods were graded poorly, investors and banks were less likely to give out loans (or made them too expensive) for homeowners attempting to live in these areas.&nbsp;</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, homeownership percentages, specifically houses where the owner lives in the building, today are still lower in these areas as compared to well graded neighborhoods. Not only that, but if we look at data regarding the population of these neighborhoods, we can see that poorly graded neighborhoods have a much larger percentage of black residents compared to other neighborhoods.</span>&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, we can look at the affordability index for each community statistical area. The affordability index is defined as the percentage of households that pay more than 30% of their total household income on mortgage and other housing-related expenses. Similarly to the other housing inequalities, we see that neighborhoods graded poorly by the HOLC face a higher affordability index. Whether it is due to a low income, or inability to get loans to help with mortgages, the people in these neighborhoods are still suffering inequalities stemming from nearly 90 years ago.</span></b>

The visual of the Hopkins Hospital being a bright white spot in a sea of red on the HOLC’s map only furthers the perception that Hopkins can thrive at the expense of the Baltimore community while remaining somehow separate.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, while Hopkins was once considering relocating to Columbia, they decided not to because “it would not have had ready access to clinical material, people with whom it could experiment”. If this weren’t enough, the University has historically also demolished Black residents’ homes to make space for the resources and accommodations they need, enforcing the HOLC’s belief that these neighborhoods have good qualities, but only if the residents are removed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In recent years, Hopkins has taken steps to remedy the damage the institution had caused, offering medical care for residents in the hospital’s surrounding ZIP codes. Nevertheless, the damage done decades ago is irreversible and the resulting distrust between these communities and the hospital is the consequence.</b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>From the data above, it is clear to see that redlining has had a lasting impact in Baltimore, similar to many other cities across the United States. As a result, the racially motivated underlying factors in the original grading have perpetuated problems to these same groups of people and same neighborhoods today. Obviously it remains impossible to undo the damage and systemic injustice that was done to neighborhoods and cities across the country; however, there are no doubt efforts that can be made to correct the actions of the HOLC.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An undeniable takeaway from researching redlining is to see that there is concrete evidence of systemic efforts to “not include these people”. Conveyed through the semantics of laws and policies created in the time, it is shocking to read how blatantly racist some are. It is clear that these policies need to be revised, and many of the long outdated phrasings need to be revisited with a set of eyes responsible for racial equity.</b>
                    <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another intuitive fix to many of the persistent problems caused by redlining, is to promote economic investment in these same areas that were deemed “too risky”. A key to this investment will be having repairs or new construction still aimed at the underserved groups. These communities have been neglected as a result of the policies implemented nearly 100 years ago, and it is a more than fair expectation that the people that were in turn bettered by the policies of the HOLC, take action and invest in these same communities.</b>
